As an example let's think that there is a factory called \"OO Car\", this factory produces two types of car \"OO Turbo\" and \"OO 4x4\". You agree with me that these cars have a factory, 4 wheels, 1 engine, color, ..... and several other parts. We won't go into all the details. But imagine you as a programmer, defining a class for each car and most of the time they will have the same details. Being in this context the company \"OO Car\", develops a new car. Again you will have to create a class with the same characteristics as the previous cars. So you will be creating a huge duplicity without having to. This is where object orientation comes in. We define only one class so that we can reuse it for different cars.\n",
